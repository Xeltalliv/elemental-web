# elemental-web

Very unfinished thing that is in the future might become an alternative web client for https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.veam.elemental https://github.com/GoVed/Elemental

Currently lets you provide game data and combine elements offline. Original game data is not provided. Local saving isn't implemented either.
